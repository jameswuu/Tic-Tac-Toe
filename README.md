# Tic Tac Toe Game
=====================

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows two players to play against each other, with features to restart the game and display the winner or a draw.

## Features
------------

- **Two-Player Game**: Supports two players, "X" and "O", taking turns to mark their moves on the board.
- **Restart Game**: Includes a restart button to reset the game state and start a new game.
- **Win/Draw Detection**: Automatically detects when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.
- **Dynamic Board Update**: The game board updates dynamically as players make their moves.

## Usage
-----

1. **Start Game**: The game starts automatically when the page loads. Player "X" goes first.
2. **Make Moves**: Click on an empty cell on the game board to place your mark.
3. **Restart Game**: Click the "Restart?!" button to reset the game state and start over.

## Technical Details
-------------------

- **Frontend**: Built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for game logic.
- **Game Logic**: Implemented using modular JavaScript code with IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) for encapsulation.
- **Event Handling**: Uses event listeners to handle user interactions such as clicking on the game board cells and the restart button.

## Future Enhancements
----------------------

- **AI Opponent**: Implement a simple AI opponent for single-player mode.
- **Multiplayer Online**: Develop the game to support online multiplayer functionality.
- **Enhanced UI**: Improve the user interface with more intuitive design elements and responsive layout.
