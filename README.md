# Tic-Tac-Toe

### Description
The old-school game Tic-Tac-Toe is a great exercise to practice managing the object pattern in a clean and clear manner. This project will mainly focus on developing factories while minimizing global code as much as possible. Objects such as Player, Gameboard, and Score will be created in this project.
