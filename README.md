# Tic-Tac-Toe

### Description
The classic game Tic-Tac-Toe is an excellent exercise for practicing the object pattern in a clean and clear manner. This project will primarily focus on developing factory functions while minimizing global code as much as possible. Additionally, the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) technique will be implemented to keep the code secure and coherent.
